## There and Back Again: Revisiting Backpropagation Saliency Methods

Standalone code for the paper: There and Back Again: Revisiting Backpropagation Saliency Methods, CVPR 2020 by Sylvestre-Alvise Rebuffi*, Ruth Fong*, Xu Ji* and Andrea Vedaldi

For better analysis tools and to perform the benchmarks on Pascal or COCO, we recommend to use TorchRay where all the saliency methods of the paper are implemented.
